### Making a Leaflet Map
Here, I have made a leaflet map in which two places are marked namely - Home and Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal(my university). Clicking on the marker will present a pop-up with the name of the location, making the map an interactive one.

Step 1: Create the leaflet map object.
```{r}
library(leaflet)
map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()
```

Step 2: Add markers of the locations we wanna mark.

```{r}
map <- map %>% 
  addMarkers(lat=11.217021, lng= 77.860178, popup="Home") %>%
  addMarkers(lat=13.3525,lng=74.7928, popup="Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal")
map
```
